      <description>&lt;p&gt;If god ever comes in my dream&lt;br&gt;
And offers to grant me a wish&lt;br&gt;
I would wish for&lt;br&gt;
The endurance of a woman&lt;br&gt;
Who has seen her rapist&lt;br&gt;
In the eyes&lt;br&gt;
And lived to a ripe age&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— PD&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen grief,&lt;br&gt;
I have only known that it walks quietly,&lt;br&gt;
In and around my room.&lt;br&gt;
And that it can see through me,&lt;br&gt;
Like I am made of glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I sleep,&lt;br&gt;
It carefully prepares a potion,&lt;br&gt;
Of everything bittersweet I remember,&lt;br&gt;
And boy, it carries a big sack of cotton balls.&lt;br&gt;
It dips them one by one, in the potion,&lt;br&gt;
Counting carefully till hundred.&lt;br&gt;
Then it puts my head in its lap,&lt;br&gt;
In it&amp;rsquo;s warm lap.&lt;br&gt;
And people who have been there,&lt;br&gt;
Would agree, how hard it is to get out of there.&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, grief puts my head in its lap,&lt;br&gt;
And then carefully drops the cotton balls,&lt;br&gt;
Gently, in my ears, shaking my head gently,&lt;br&gt;
To make space for more.&lt;br&gt;
When my head is full,&lt;br&gt;
And there is still some potion left,&lt;br&gt;
It traces them gently, from my eyes,&lt;br&gt;
Down to my chin.&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s all great, except, that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to&lt;br&gt;
Convince people, that you were not crying.&lt;br&gt;
You spent a night in the lap of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— PD&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I and You</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We ride the waves, I and you.&lt;br&gt;
On a wrecked down boat, far from shore.&lt;br&gt;
We are bruised a little, and ready for more.&lt;br&gt;
We make a world in our heads, and then,&lt;br&gt;
We put some sunlight in there, and some rain,&lt;br&gt;
In our world there is no-one, to wake us out of dream,&lt;br&gt;
There is no-one to get us,&lt;br&gt;
There are no f***ing sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big rewind button,&lt;br&gt;
To play the sweet memories.&lt;br&gt;
And there is an erase button,&lt;br&gt;
to purge the bitter stories.&lt;br&gt;
I can turn into a sparrow,&lt;br&gt;
And come flying to you.&lt;br&gt;
This is a world I would wish for,&lt;br&gt;
If I could start anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— PD&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Dread</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I dread 11 PM.&lt;br&gt;
I dread happy people.&lt;br&gt;
I dread happy people telling me happy stories&lt;br&gt;
At 11 PM on a Monday. Or any day of the week.&lt;br&gt;
I dread unbearable, continuous gossips,&lt;br&gt;
And I dread complete silence too.&lt;br&gt;
Silence in which I can hear my poor heart sing&lt;br&gt;
An elegy.&lt;br&gt;
For whom? I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;br&gt;
I dread being hard on myself,&lt;br&gt;
For things that were out of my control.&lt;br&gt;
I dread falling prey, to the pattern&lt;br&gt;
In which these events keep repeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dread knowing, and I dread not knowing.&lt;br&gt;
I dread the day, when my mind would declare&lt;br&gt;
Victory over my heart, or vice-versa.
I dread meeting someone, whom I would want&lt;br&gt;
To shelter under my own skin.&lt;br&gt;
And not being able to explain it to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— PD&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blind Spot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It starts with the eyes, then come ears&lt;br&gt;
Follow them tongue, nose and skin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyes, I read about them in science class&lt;br&gt;
They have a blind spot, which makes sense, after all these years.&lt;br&gt;
It happened one Saturday morning,&lt;br&gt;
Like this one.&lt;br&gt;
Going through an old photo album&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought,&lt;br&gt;
Where are they,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the people who were once visible,&lt;br&gt;
You could touch them.&lt;br&gt;
You saw them all over the place.&lt;br&gt;
Where are they now, I hope they exist.&lt;br&gt;
In the blind spot of my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— PD&lt;/p&gt;
