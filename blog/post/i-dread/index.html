I dread happy people.
I dread happy people telling me happy stories
At 11 PM on a Monday. Or any day of the week.
I dread unbearable, continuous gossips,
And I dread complete silence too.
Silence in which I can hear my poor heart sing
An elegy.
For whom? I don&rsquo;t know.
I dread being hard on myself,
For things that were out of my control.">

I dread happy people.<br>
I dread happy people telling me happy stories<br>
At 11 PM on a Monday. Or any day of the week.<br>
I dread unbearable, continuous gossips,<br>
And I dread complete silence too.<br>
Silence in which I can hear my poor heart sing<br>
An elegy.<br>
For whom? I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
I dread being hard on myself,<br>
For things that were out of my control.<br>
I dread falling prey, to the pattern<br>
In which these events keep repeating.</p>
<p>I dread knowing, and I dread not knowing.<br>
I dread the day, when my mind would declare<br>
Victory over my heart, or vice-versa.
I dread meeting someone, whom I would want<br>
To shelter under my own skin.<br>
And not being able to explain it to them.</p>
