I have only known that it walks quietly,
In and around my room.
And that it can see through me,
Like I am made of glass.
While I sleep,
It carefully prepares a potion,
Of everything bittersweet I remember,
And boy, it carries a big sack of cotton balls.
It dips them one by one, in the potion,
Counting carefully till hundred.
Then it puts my head in its lap,">

    <p>I haven&rsquo;t seen grief,<br>
I have only known that it walks quietly,<br>
In and around my room.<br>
And that it can see through me,<br>
Like I am made of glass.</p>
<p>While I sleep,<br>
It carefully prepares a potion,<br>
Of everything bittersweet I remember,<br>
And boy, it carries a big sack of cotton balls.<br>
It dips them one by one, in the potion,<br>
Counting carefully till hundred.<br>
Then it puts my head in its lap,<br>
In it&rsquo;s warm lap.<br>
And people who have been there,<br>
Would agree, how hard it is to get out of there.<br>
Anyway, grief puts my head in its lap,<br>
And then carefully drops the cotton balls,<br>
Gently, in my ears, shaking my head gently,<br>
To make space for more.<br>
When my head is full,<br>
And there is still some potion left,<br>
It traces them gently, from my eyes,<br>
Down to my chin.<br>
It&rsquo;s all great, except, that it&rsquo;s hard to<br>
Convince people, that you were not crying.<br>
You spent a night in the lap of grief.</p>
<p>— PD</p>
